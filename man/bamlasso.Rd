\arguments{
\item{x}{input matrix, of dimension nobs x nvars; each row is an observation vector.}

\item{y}{response variable. Quantitative for family="gaussian", or family="poisson" (non-negative counts).
For family="binomial", y should be either a factor with two levels, or a two-column matrix of counts or proportions (the second column is treated as the target class; for a factor, the last level in alphabetical order is the target class).
For family="cox", y should be a two-column matrix with columns named 'time' and 'status'. The latter is a binary variable, with '1' indicating death, and '0' indicating right censored. The function Surv() in package \bold{survival} produces such a matrix.}

\item{family}{Response type (see above).}

\item{offset}{A vector of length nobs that is included in the linear predictor.}

\item{epsilon}{positive convergence tolerance e; the iterations converge when |dev - dev_{old}|/(|dev| + 0.1) < e.}

\item{maxit}{integer giving the maximal number of EM iterations.}

\item{init}{vector of initial values for all coefficients (not for intercept). If not given, it will be internally produced.}

\item{alpha}{\code{alpha=1}: mixture double-exponential prior; \code{alpha=0}: mixture normal prior.}

\item{ss}{a vector of two positive scale values (ss\link{1} < ss\link{2}) for the spike-and-slab mixture prior, leading to different shrinkage on different predictors and allowing for incorporation of group information.}

\item{b}{group-specific inclusion probabilities follow beta(1,b). The tuning parameter \code{b} can be a vector of group-specific values.}

\item{inter.parents}{a numeric vector, or an integer, or a list defining the groups of predictors.
If \code{group = NULL}, all the predictors form a single group.
If \code{group = K}, the predictors are evenly divided into groups each with \code{K} predictors.
If \code{group} is a numberic vector, it defines groups as follows: Group 1: \code{(group[1]+1):group[2]}, Group 2: \code{(group[2]+1):group[3]}, Group 3: \code{(group[3]+1):group[4]}, .....
If \code{group} is a list of variable names, \code{group[[k]]} includes variables in the k-th group.
The mixture prior is only used for grouped predictors. For ungrouped predictors, the prior is double-exponential or normal with scale \code{ss[2]} and mean 0.}

\item{Warning}{logical. If \code{TRUE}, show the error messages of not convergence and identifiability.}

\item{verbose}{logical. If \code{TRUE}, print out number of iterations and computational time.}
}
\value{
This function returns all outputs from the function \code{\link{glmnet}}, and some other values used in Bayesian hierarchical models.
